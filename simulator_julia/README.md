# On The Choice of Julia

I currently choose against Julia for this project.
While Julia looks great, some of its functionality is simply not fleshed out enough for a codebase with our timeframe.
In particular, DataFrame is lacking a lot of functionality and there are not very many convenient structures available for instantiating types.
Full steam ahead with Python for now.
